# CarbOnBal_Laptop
Java laptop GUI for the CarbOnBal Arduino Carb and throttle body sync hardware

Note this is very much experimental software, use at your own risk. 
Although you're free to follow my progress or even contribute, I can offer no support for this software AT ALL.
If you have to ask how to use it, don't bother.

CarbOnBal is primarily a stand-alone hardware project and does not depend on this software, nor will it ever. 
This software should ultimately become "the icing on the cake" so to speak.
